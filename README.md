# Obesity-level-estimation
The project is the part of the Intermediate Machine Learning course I am taking on the Codeacademy platform. 
## Features: 
- Gender 
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Family history
- Frequency of high calorie food
- Vegetable consumption
- Number of meals
- Snacks
- SMOKE
- Water consumption 
- Calories monitoring
- Frequency of physical activity
- Technology usage
- Alcohol consumption 
- Transportation way
- Obesity level(Target)

## Class labels:
- Insufficient Weight
- Normal Weight
- Overweight Level I
- Overweight Level II
- Obesity Type I
- Obesity Type II
- Obesity Type III

From the list of features, it is interesting to explore how various features influence the class classification. Moreover, I did not know about the range of obesity levels that is presented in the dataset. 
Thus, the goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that accurately estimate a personâ€™s obesity level based on their physical condition and lifestyle habits.

Specifically, I aim to:

- Predict obesity categories  using classification models
- Compare performance between logistic regression (with regularization), random forest, and a stacking ensemble. Stacking ensemble is the most interesting to me during my learning process to explore.
